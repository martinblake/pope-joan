## Rounds

Each game consists of multiple rounds in which each player takes it in turns
to dress the board.  The player dressing the board in each round is clearly
indicated by an outline.

## Phases

Each round is organised into 2 phases:
 * Dressing - The only expected input is a request for board dressing.
 * Scoring - Scores for the round are entered and submitted (no dressing allowed).
